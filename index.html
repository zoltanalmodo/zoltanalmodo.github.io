                <h2>- Bio</h2>
                    <h3>
                        i was born in a small town called Mezokovesd in Hungary.<br>
                        this is me on the picture with a painting of my great-grandmother.<br>
                        we used to play together when i was a little child... a memory i treasure a lot!<br>
                    </h3>

                <h2>- Motivation</h2>
                    <h3>
                        /how i started programming<br>
                        <br>
                        i have a passion for creation and i express it by drawing, painting and design.<br>
                        during my studies as an industrial designer i learned how to analyze problems and build products to solve them.<br>
                        <br>
                        i started programming at around 2013 in Html / CSS when i was working on a webshop for a London based furniture shop called OneDeko at Old Spitalfields market.<br>
                        <br>
                        the shop was runned on Prestashop (a popular free ecommerce CMS platform) which meant i had to modify it here and there using Html and CSS.<br>
                        i migrated the shop from version to version and had to learn more about Mysql, CSV, fix few bugs on the Theme's CSS, or install some addons by reading the code and following instructions.<br>
                        this is how i learned more about programming.<br>
                        <br>
                        later on i started to work from home and had a bit more time this allowed me to attend meetups.<br>
                        <br>
                        since then i learned a lot, played with coding and finally managed to build my first website.<br>

                <h2>- Tech interests</h2>

                    <h3>/my way here<br>
                        <br>
                        i had an idea about an application for artists to draw submit and mix drawings with others.<br>
                        <br>
                        i call it Doodle Disco.<br>
                        i decided to build it as best as i can. first with a developer friend of mine...<br>
                        we did an early mockup with some basic functions on an iPhone.<br>
                        suddenly he had to leave as he had a baby boy and he could no longer work together on the project.<br>
                        i started to look for developers in London and attended various meetups. with little to no success finding a partner.<br>
                        <br>
                        i feel what is it like to sudy in a community with like minded people.<br>
                        also know that to build something requires a team of people so to enter the program would allow me to make friends and participate in common projects would get me more experience.<br>
                        <br>
                        i feel like i often just need someone to show my code to and it takes just a different approach for things to click together.<br>
                        this is much faster than i could learn on my own.<br>
                        i got a lot of guidance and learning material which helped me a lot!<br>
                        <br>
                        i know i would have to find employment after the course to get more experienced and learn before i can build something more complex.
                        <br>

                        this is one of the ideas i would like to build one day.<br>
                        <br>
                        a drawing tool + community platform in one which allows anyone to draw with their finger (or mouse) and submit drawings or parts of drawings into a database.<br>
                        users can share their creations with others on various platforms and devices throughout the internet.<br>
                        <br>
                        it raises some quiestions about today's artworld:<br>
                        what is art today? how do we access and view art? who is an artist? what artists are doing? how art shapes society?<br>
                        and how could art, science, software and internet technology work together to change society?<br>
                        <br>
                        thought of artists and scientists like Leonardo and Michelangelo they were all learning the newest techniques and concepts of their time.<br>
                        i imagined when perspective was changing the way of illustrating a 3 dmiensional space in 2 a dimensional surface.<br>
                        <br>
                        i know that if i want to create something meaningful today, i have to know how to read and write code and develop software.<br>
